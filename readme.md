An application to demostrate the features of Rxjs.
It is an Earthquake monitor application which shows the recent earthquakes on the map, taking data from the USGS website.
Features:
- Make data from the USGS website
- Show data on leaflet map
- Allow creation of focus area on the map and give special notification for that area

Code for above features without Rxjs would have been very complex and difficult to maintain and the file without-rx.js contains the code to explain same.
